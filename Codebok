##Data description:data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

-'README.txt': describes about the general information and background related to the data sets within the zip file.

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

 - 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

 - 'train/subject_train.txt':   Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample.

  	 - 'test/subject_test.txt':  Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample.
  	    
   ##data sets not used in the current project. 

   	 - 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt'; 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt';
   	   'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt'. More information related to these three data sets can be
   	    found in 'README.txt', 'feature_info.txt' and 'feature.txt' and the original website.
##### Unit:

Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]. Therefore they are unitless.

##Clean Data
Tidy data set: new variable names
-- lower cases; removed bad characters "()"; replaced "-" to "."

##How to begin
# Get Data and Unzip to project directory

# File URL to download
fileURL <- 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip'
##Local directory path and unzipping files
zip_file_path <-"Downloads"
temp_dir <- tempdir()
unzip("Downloads", exdir = temp_dir)

# Read training and testing datasets
training = read.csv("UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt", sep="", header=FALSE)
training[,562] = read.csv("UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt", sep="", header=FALSE)
training[,563] = read.csv("UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt", sep="", header=FALSE)



##How to: steps in run_analysis.R to process the raw data sets and create clean data set
### install special package "reshape2"
###Merges the training and the test data sets to create one data set 
###Get the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
###Name the activities in the data set
###Label the data set with descriptive activity names
###Creates the clean/tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


#Then
 #R code: run_analysis.R
